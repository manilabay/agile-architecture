# agile-architecture

Now, when Architecture is consolidating as an IT and Biz discipline, sorry, I want introduce another new baby concept, Agile Architecture. I thought about it with my previous architecture roles and now I will offer an approached solution to help Architect teams.

In my view the common sense transition from Architecture to Agile Architecture is:
* A collaboration job
* A shared duty (not only for architects)
* A way to accelerate architecture itself using agile methodologies. Sorry architect mates ;)

I will put agile architecture in practice in this repo, using my approach solution with my another repo: [git + dot + graphviz](https://github.com/manilabay/dot-graphviz-aws) to build and maintain any of my architecture deliverables henceforth. It has agile, reuse and traceability advantages.

So, here I want start sharing some Architecture Deliverables doing agile architecture:

* [Data Pipeline Architecture Reference](https://github.com/manilabay/dot-graphviz-aws/tree/master/diagrams/data-pipeline-architecture-reference)
* [AWS E2E Architecture Reference](https://github.com/manilabay/dot-graphviz-aws)
