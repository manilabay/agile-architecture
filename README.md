# agile-architecture

Now, when Architecture is consolidating as an IT and Biz discipline, apologies, I want introduce another new baby concept, Agile Architecture or Architecture as a code (AaaC). I thought about it within my previous architecture roles and now I will offer an approached solution to help Architect teams.

In my view the key points and common sense transition from Architecture to Agile Architecture is:

Architecture should be:
* A collaboration job.
* A shared duty (not only for architects).
* An integrated discipline with Business and Society.
* A way to accelerate architecture itself using agile methodologies. Sorry architect mates ;)

I will put agile architecture in practice in this repo, using my approach solution with my another repo: [git + dot + graphviz](https://github.com/manilabay/dot-graphviz) to build and maintain any of my architecture deliverables henceforth. It has agile, reuse and traceability advantages.

So, here I want start sharing some Architecture Deliverables doing agile architecture:

* [Data Pipeline Architecture Reference](https://github.com/manilabay/dot-graphviz-aws/tree/master/diagrams/data-pipeline-architecture-reference)
* [AWS E2E Architecture Reference](https://github.com/manilabay/dot-graphviz/tree/master/diagrams/mt-challenge-solution)
* [Blockchain ELI5 graphs](https://github.com/manilabay/blockchain-graphs)
* [Ethereum Agile Architecture](https://github.com/manilabay/ethereum-agile-architecture)
